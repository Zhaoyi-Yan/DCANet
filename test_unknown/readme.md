# Hi

This folder contains three scripts: config.py, test_unknown.py, and Estimator_unknown.py. These scripts should replace the corresponding files or be added to the appropriate folders.

For example, if you want to validate the model trained on Phase3Cb_fast using your own images without ground truth counts, you need to replace the existing config.py and test_unknown.py with the new ones provided. Additionally, copy the Estimator_unknown.py file into the eval folder.

Please note that these three scripts are not exactly compatible with DCANet, as they were originally copied from another private project. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to dedicate to adapting these files for this repository. However, making the necessary adjustments should be relatively simple if you go through the codebase. With only slight modifications, these scripts should work well for your needs.

# bonus

Also I add another scripts for fun.
